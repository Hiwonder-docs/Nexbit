## 8.3 Intelligent Obstacle Clearing

:::{Note}

* Due to the reliance on the visual module in this game, ensure recognition under good lighting conditions to avoid potential impact on recognition results.

* It is recommended to use the forward-facing posture.

* Before starting, assemble the car into the hinge model and bend it downwards to 90 degrees.

:::

### 8.3.1 Getting Ready

In the program, through the recognition of color blocks, control the car to clear obstacles during the line-following process.

Before starting, ensure that the batteries are fully charged and correctly installed in the car's battery slot. Do not reverse the positive and negative terminals.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image1.png"   />

Connect the WonderCam Vision Module to any I2C interface on the car.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image2.png"   />

### 8.3.2 Program Flowchart

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image3.png"   />

### 8.3.3 Module Introduction

The user-friendly WonderCam vision module can complete AI training with just one click. It can directly output recognition results to the controller, making it easy to implement various AI visual creative projects.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image4.png"  />

Connect the WonderCam Vision Module to any I2C interface on the robot.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image2.png"   />

Adjust the threshold of the line followers. Ensure that each sensor is in the off state when it detects the black line on the map, and in the on state when it detects the white area on the map. The robot needs to be assembled into a hinge model, with the vision module bent downwards by 90 degrees. Install the robotic gripper simultaneously. After installation, it should appear as shown in the following picture:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image5.jpeg"   />

### 8.3.4 Program Analysis

* **Device Initialization**

After starting the car, it will go through an initialization process. This includes setting the address of the WonderCam Vision Module, switching to the **"Color Recognition"** function, setting the initial position of the servo, and initializing relevant variables.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image6.png"  />

The variable **"EnableLineFollow" i**s a switch for line-following movement. When it is set to 1, the car follows the line, and when set to 0, it stops line-following.

The variable **"Grip"** is a switch for gripping color blocks. When it is set to 0, gripping is performed, and when set to 1, gripping is not performed.

The variable **"Place"** is a switch for placing color blocks. When it is set to 0, placing is performed, and when set to 1, placing is not performed.

* **Sub-function Analysis**

(1) Define the **'Update Line Following'** function

By calling this function, the sensor detection status can be updated in real-time. In this context, the values of the line-following sensor probes are set to indicate the detection of a black line.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image7.png"  />

(2) Define the **'General Line Following'** function

Calling this function enables the car to perform line-following movements.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image8.png"  />

As follows:

① If line-following sensors 2 and 3 detect the black line, the car is directed to move forward. (Note: The speed of motor 1 and motor 2 during forward movement should be set based on the differential drive system of your specific car.)

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image9.png"  />

② If the line-following sensors 1 and 2 detect the black line while sensors 3 and 4 do not detect the black line, it indicates that the car is veering to the right. In this case, the car needs to turn left.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image10.png"  />

③ Similarly, if line-following sensors 3 and 4 detect the black line while sensors 1 and 2 do not detect the black line, it indicates that the car is veering to the left. In this case, the car needs to turn right.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image11.png"  />

④ If line-following sensor 2 detects the black line and sensors 1, 3, and 4 do not detect the black line, indicating a slight deviation to the right, the program instructs the car to make a slight left turn. (Note: When the turning radius is small, the speed of motor 1 and motor 2 should be set based on the differential drive system of your specific car.)

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image12.png"  />

⑤ Similarly, if line-following sensor 3 detects the black line and sensors 1, 2, and 4 do not detect the black line, indicating a slight deviation to the left, the program instructs the car to make a slight right turn. (Note: When the turning radius is small, the speed of motor 1 and motor 2 should be set based on the differential drive system of your specific car.)

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image13.png"  />

(3) Define the **'Grip Block'** function

Calling this function enables the car to grip a block.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image14.png"  />

① When gripping, first make the car move forward a short distance to bring the color block into the grip range of the claw.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image15.png"  />

② Then, pause the line-following process, close the mechanical claw, and begin gripping the color block.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image16.png"  />

③ After gripping is completed, set **"Grip"** to 1 and **"Place"** to 0 to initiate the placement of the color block.

(4) Define the **'Place Block'** function

Calling this function enables the placement of the color block.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image17.png"  />

As follows:

① When one of the four probes of the line-following sensor detects a black line, turn the car to the left. As the car has not yet reached the placement position, at this point, set it to turn left for 100ms and release the mechanical claw.<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image18.png"  />

② When none of the four probes of the line-following sensor are on the black line, make the car reverse. Continue reversing until the condition is no longer met, then exit.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image19.png"  />

③ Set the **"Place"** variable to 1 to prevent the car from performing further placement operations. Set the **"EnableLineFollow"** variable to 1 to allow the car to continue line-following and clearing obstacles.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image20.png"  />

* **Main Function Analysis**

Utilizing an infinite loop to keep the program continuously executing, this function defines the operational flow of intelligent obstacle clearing. A detailed analysis is as follows:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image21.png"  />

(1\) Update the detection status of the line-following sensor and obtain the results of color recognition. When the **"EnableLineFollow"** variable is set to 1, call the general line-following function to perform line-following movements.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image22.png"  />

(2\) During the line-following process, if a color block with ID 1 is recognized, stop line-following and set the **"EnableLineFollow"** variable and the **"Grip"** variable to 0.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image23.png"  />

(3\) When the **"EnableLineFollow"** variable is 0 and the **"Grip"** variable is 0, call the function **"Grip Block"** to grip the color block.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image24.png"  />

(4\) As shown in the diagram below, when the color block gripping is completed, the variable **"Grip"** is set to 1, and **"Place"** is set to 0. At this point, the function **"Place Block"** is called to place the color block.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_3/media/image25.png"  />

## 8.5 Handlebit Remote Handling

:::{Note}

The demonstration video in this section uses a top-down perspective as an example, and the content is equally applicable to other perspectives. Please prepare two micro:bit boards in advance, and purchase the Handlebit handle.

:::

### 8.5.1 Getting Ready

This project controls the car’s movement via the Handlebit handle.

Before starting, ensure that the batteries are fully charged and correctly installed in the car's battery slot. Do not reverse the positive and negative terminals.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_5/media/image2.png"   />

### 8.5.2 Program Flowchart

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_5/media/image4.png"   />

### 8.5.3 Module Introduction

The micro:bit board comes with a built-in wireless transmission and reception module. You only need to invoke its module to achieve wireless data transmission.

The position of Bluetooth transmission on the micro:bit, as shown in the diagram:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_5/media/image5.png"   />

Each button on the Handlebit handle corresponds to a number, and when pressed, this number can be wirelessly transmitted. When the robot receives this number, you can write corresponding execution statements. This way, through this "two-way" communication, wireless transmission and control are achieved.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_5/media/image6.jpeg"  />

### 8.5.4 Program Analysis

The following diagram is the main program of sender:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_5/media/image7.png"   />

The following diagram is the main program of receiver:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_8/section_5/media/image8.png"  />

:::{Note}

Due to different usage scenarios, values for motor and time settings need to be adjusted based on the actual conditions.

:::

Firstly, the transmitter, which is the program for our Handlebit handle, performs initialization during startup. At the same time, it sets the wireless transmission group, with the default being group 1. The subsequent receiver must also be set to group 1 to receive wireless messages sent by the transmitter.

Next is the definition of the buttons that the handle will use. For example, when we move the joystick, the micro:bit board will calculate the X and Y values of the joystick. When moved to a certain extent, it will then emit the corresponding signal.

Then, moving on to the receiver, similarly, the receiver will first perform initialization operations on the robot. It will set the wireless group to 1 so that both sides can establish a connection. After that, it will set initial variables for the subsequent control of the claw servo motor.

Upon receiving messages from the transmitter, the receiver will execute the corresponding actions. For instance, if it receives message number 3, indicating that the joystick is pushed backward, the corresponding action would be the car moving backward. You can experience other specific actions after downloading the program.
