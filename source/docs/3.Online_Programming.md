# 3. Online Programming

## 3.1 Introduction to IDE

Micro:bit is a product that does require installing an IDE. Users can start programming directly through the website: <https://makecode.microbit.org/>

## 3.2 Driver Installation

:::{Note}

Please ensure the CH341 serial driver is installed on your computer as it may effect the connection and usage of the Microbit controller in the following steps.

:::

**If it is already installed, you can skip this section.**

(1) Locate the **ch341ser.exe** serial port driver installer from the [Appendix->Serial Driver Software](()) , and open it.

## 3.3 IDE Setup and Toolbar Layout

Open a browser tab and access the programming website by entering:<https://makecode.microbit.org/>

<img   class="common_img"  src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/media/image3.png"  />

To write your own code, click "**New Project**" to enter the project name.

<img   class="common_img"  src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/media/image4.png"   />

After navigating to the main interface, we can divide the screen into the following two sections as outlined below:

<img   class="common_img"  src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/media/image5.png"   />

| **Area** | **Function** |
|:--:|:--:|
| Simulation Area | Used for simulating programming instruction blocks |
| Tag Selection Area | You can use the built-in or add blocks from the extension packages for programming |
| Program Editing Area | You can insert, copy, paste, delete, modify in block editing area. |

## 3.4 Download Program 

Let's start by creating a simple program. click on the **"Basic"** tab, then drag the corresponding instruction block to add it in the code editing area, as shown in the figure below:

(6) Micro:bit will automatically run the program once it's powered on.

## 3.5 Import Program

(1) Connect the micro:bit to your computer using a USB cable. Then open the online MakeCode programming page, click **"Import"** and select **"Import file."**

<img   class="common_img"  src="../_static/media/chapter_3/section_1/media/image14.png"  />

(2) Then click "**Choose File**," select the code file to be added, and click **"Continue"** to import the code into the online compiler.
